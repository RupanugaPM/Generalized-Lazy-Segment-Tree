•	Created a Generalized Template for Persistent Lazy Segment Tree.

•	It supports various segment tree operations such as range update and range queries.

•	It also supports version control i.e. going back to the kth change made in the segment tree in just O(log(n)) extra space and time complexity where n is the size of array.


use the build method to create a segment tree node.

you can update the pulltag and applydata tags to your needs ie. the type of operation you want.

use get_prod method to range query.

use rangeop for range update.
